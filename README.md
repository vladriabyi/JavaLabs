# Java Lab 1 - 18th Variant

This repository contains the solutions to Java lab exercises, specifically the 18th variant.

## Description

In this lab, we work with matrices and perform various operations like bitwise XOR and sum calculations on matrix columns. The solution includes methods for generating matrices, performing bitwise operations, and calculating extreme values in odd and even columns.

## Tasks Implemented

This program:
1. Generates two random 4x5 matrices.
2. Performs a bitwise XOR operation on these matrices to generate a third matrix.
3. Computes the sum of the largest values from odd-indexed columns and the smallest values from even-indexed columns in the resulting matrix.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vladriabyi/javalab1.git
